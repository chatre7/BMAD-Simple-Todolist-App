# v0.1.0 (MVP)

MVP for Simple Todolist App delivering core PRD FR1–FR7:

- Add/Edit/Complete/Delete todos (inline edit)
- Tags (multi), Filter (status), Search (Thai-friendly normalization)
- Due Date with near‑due/overdue highlighting
- Sorting (createdAt/dueDate/status)
- Local persistence via LocalStorage (schemaVersion: 1)

Engineering
- React + TypeScript (Vite), Tailwind, Zustand
- Selector-based filtering/search/sorting; storage adapter abstraction
- Tests: unit + components; a11y keyboard flows; date edge cases
- CI: typecheck, tests + coverage (thresholds), build
- Coverage: uploaded to Codecov; summary posted in job summary
- GitHub Pages deploy for demo
